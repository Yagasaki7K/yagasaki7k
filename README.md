üöÄ My Relevant Projects

It was built using Next.js, Firebase, Styled Components, DayJS, Gray Matter, Framer Motion, Marked, Million, Next-SEO, Redis, Sonner and Markdown.

[**Essentials **or **Web Essentials**](https://webessentials.com.br/): It's an application for you to easily find applications that are useful for your computer after formatting, making your life easier and bringing things closer to you - it only works on the desktop - it was developed using ReactJS, NextJS, Javascript, JSON and Styled Components.

[**Steamfolio**](https://steamfolio.vercel.app/): Imagine having a development portfolio for yourself that looks like Steam and is completely personalized, with updated data straight from Github?
